\chapter{Introduction}
    This is the Bot Specification - here every feature and their usage will
    be documented! In the first chapter the core structure of the bot is 
    explained in detail and some decisions concerning the project organization
    are discussed. Apart from general design decisions, Chapter 1 will also 
    include a quick overview over the project goals and milestones for the 
    near future.

\chapter[Core]{Core Structure}
    `pp-cli' consists out of 3 components, which are crucial for it to work!
    Events Handlers, Commands and Services are the three backbones of this 
    project. Event Handlers take Events from the Discord API and work with 
    them - for example, fetch them to detect and eventually trigger commands
    or use them to classify data for a future machine learning subproject!
    Commands are the part of the project that is triggered by certain events
    and usually processes and outputs a user message or accesses and possibly
    alters the database (soon to be implemented)!
